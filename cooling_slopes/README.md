# cooling_slopes

This folder contains the data points used to determine `f1(t)` and `f2(t)` the functions defining the rates of change. `f1(t)` describes the temperature from the cutoff time to the max temperature. `f2(t)` describes the temperature from the max temperature cooling to the cutoff temperature.

A more detailed description of the testing and analysis can be found in
